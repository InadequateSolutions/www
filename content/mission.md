## Today's Solutions, Tomorrow...

In July of 1969, human beings not only stepped foot on the moon, but also managed to return to Earth safely! This epic feat was achieved using a 16-bit guidance computer operating with a 1.024 MHz clock and consisting only of NOR gates, expanders, amplifiers, 2,048 16-bit words of erasable magnetic core memory, and 36,864 words of read-only core rope memory. Thanks to truly incredible engineers, humanity achieved so much with so little.

Today, we honor and stand on the shoulders of these technical giants by mass-producing aggressively mediocre Internet-connected crap that treats users as little more than meaty data sources. And yet, we're so very much in love with our e-waste-in-training that when the latest model is launched, we gleefully *"recycle"* our old devices right onto the shores of countries we audaciously deem too poor to matter. 

**Inadequate Solutions** proudly strives to accomplish something -- literally *anything* -- and will do it passionately, ethically, sustainably, and transparently.

Unlike those other *profit-driven* corporations, we readily admit that we're not very good at things and probably will never manage to do anything that significantly improves humanity. In fact, at this point, the best we can really aim to do is avoid further destruction of this poor planet and just die already.

With that being said, we hope you'll consider us for all of your turnkey engineering needs. Together, we'll passionately build something under-scoped, underwhelming, and way over budget. It might just even work sometimes!
